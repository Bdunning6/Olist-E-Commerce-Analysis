## Introduction
Olist is an online e-commerce platform that operates out of Brazil allowing for sellers to offer a variety of products to customers. Through this project, I will analyze an Olist data set in order to answer the following four broad questions:

1. How did Olist perform sales wise? Where is Olist the most successful?

2. Where in does Olist perform poorly in Brazil? Why? 

3. What products are the most popular? Which products recieve the most sales?

4. How well reviewed are Olist products? Can the delivery length of an item positively or negatively affect reviews?

Besides these questions, other insights about the Brazilian E-commerce market and Olist will be developed as well.


## Dataset 
The dataset holds around a 100,000 orders from 2016 to 2018. It is made up of a schema that holds 9 tables. The 9 tables are:

* olist_order_reviews_dataset
* olist_orders_dataset
* olist_order_payment_dataset
* olist_order_item_dataset
* olist_product_dataset
* olist_sellers_dataset
* olist_geolocation_dataset
* olist_order_customer_dataset
* product_category_name_translation
