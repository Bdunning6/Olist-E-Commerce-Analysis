## Introduction
Olist is an online e-commerce platform that operates out of Brazil allowing for sellers to offer a variety of products to customers. Through this project, I will analyze an Olist data set to answer the following four broad questions:

1. How did Olist perform sales in sales? Where is Olist the most successful?

2. Where does Olist perform poorly in Brazil? Why are sales lower in other certain regions and states? 

3. What product categories are the most popular? Which product categories receive the most sales?

4. How well reviewed are Olist products? Can the delivery length of an item positively or negatively affect reviews?

Besides these questions, other insights about the Brazilian E-commerce market and Olist will be developed as well.



## Dataset 
The dataset holds around a 100,000 orders from 2016 to 2018. It is made up of a schema that holds 9 tables. The 9 tables are:

* olist_order_reviews_dataset
* olist_orders_dataset
* olist_order_payment_dataset
* olist_order_item_dataset
* olist_product_dataset
* olist_sellers_dataset
* olist_geolocation_dataset
* olist_order_customer_dataset
* product_category_name_translation

## Summary 

**Question 1: How did Olist perform sales in sales? Where is Olist the most successful?**

From September 2016 to October 2018, Olist had a total of 99,440 orders and $16,008,872 in sales. The average product sale was $154.00. November 2017 saw the highest number of orders as well as the highest number of sales. There were 7863 orders and $1,194,820 in sales for the month. The high increase in orders and sales could be due to a high increase in E-commerce due to Black Friday shopping. The Southeastern region dominated in sales and orders compared to all the other regions. The Southeast Region had 68,265 orders, which is about 68.6% of all orders. This region also made $10.34 million out of the total $16.00 million in sales. Looking at the top states in terms of total orders and sales, we can see S達o Paulo, Rio de Janero and Minas Gerias are the top 3 states and are all a part of the Southeast region. With further examination we can see that S達o Paulo had the most orders and sales out of every state in Brazil with about 42,000 orders and $6 million in total sales. 

**Question 2: Why are Sales Lower in Other Regions?**

We can see that Olist performed well in the Southeast and South regions, but why were sales lower in the other regions of Brazil? The main reason could be that the prices on average are much higher in the North, Northeast and Central regions compared to the South and Southeastern regions. We can see that Paraiba had the highest average price of $191.48 while S達o Paulo had the lowest average price of $109.65. S達o Paulo had the lowest average shipping costs at $15.15 while Roraima had the highest average shipping cost at $42.98. One reason the price could be higher is due to higher shipping costs. Olist is based in the state of Paran叩 which is in the Southern region of Brazil. This gives Olist proximity to one of the most populated regions of Brazil, the Southeastern region. Looking further into shipping costs, we can see that the average shipping costs for all of Brazil is about $20, while the Southeast Average shipping cost is $17.36. The other regions and states hold much higher shipping costs. The average shipping cost in the North is 36.84, 32.07 in the Northeast and 23.08 in the Central regions. The higher shipping costs could be due to distance from the region/state Olist is based in. The longer the distance traveled, the higher the shipping costs. 

**Question 3: What products categories are the most popular? Which products categories receive the most sales?**

The bed, bath and table category received the most orders at 11,115 orders while the health/beauty and sport leisure products came in second and third. The health and beauty section were the second most ordered product category and brought in the most total sales at about $1.45 million. Watches had the second highest total sales while the bed, bath and table product category had the third highest total sales. Looking at the average sales of each product category, we can see that the computer category had the highest average sales by far, holding an average sales value of $1,182. Although the computer category had the highest average sales, it was towards the bottom of the rankings when it came towards total products sold and total sales with only 203 products sold and 237,937 while being towards the bottom of the total sales and total orders charts with only 203 computers were sold. This may indicate that computers are too expensive for the average Olist customer to purchase. 
Looking at the payment types, the use of credit card dominated the boleto (a payment method in Brazil that's regulated by the Federal Bank), voucher and debit card. Using this information, a potential seller on Olist should look to sell either bed, bath and table products or health/beauty products. The potential seller should also make sure that they can take multiple forms of payment, especially the credit card and boleto since these are the most used forms of payment on Olist.

**Question 4: How well reviewed are Olist products? Can the delivery length of an item positively or negatively affect reviews?**

Delivery and the shipment of products is a vital part of e-commerce. This dataset provided numerous recorded dates, including the date the product was purchased, the date the payment method was approved, the date Olist expected the shipped product to arrive to the customer and the actual delivery date. Using these dates, I was able to find out how many products arrived early (before the estimated delivery date) and late (after the estimated delivery date). Most of the products arrived early, although this may be because Olist gives out estimation dates much later than the date they would arrive. Furthermore, we can investigate the average review score for the orders that arrived early and the orders that arrived late. The average review score for all Olists orders is 4.09. The average review score for the orders that came before the estimated delivery date was 4.29 and the average review score for the orders that can later than the estimated delivery date was 2.57, which tells us that a belated delivery leads to more negative reviews.
